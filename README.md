# Tennis Club Platform ðŸŽ¾

An online platform for a local tennis club. </br>
Members of the club can book the court in timeslots, view latest events, find match partners, organize competitions and edit their profile. </br>
Available on Android, iOS and the web. 

## Features
- [ ] Users can view court reservations for a given day
- [ ] Users can reserve a free court in timeslots (hourly)
- [ ] Users can delete their court reservations 

## Technology
- Frontend: Flutter will be used to develop both, the mobile app for Android and iOS and the website. 
  The goal is to use the same codebase for the mobile app and the website. 
  Provider and ChangeNotifier will be used for state-management.
- Backend: Firebase. 

## What I want to learn
- Get some experience with Firebase.
  - What services do they offer?
  - What about performance?
  - How to model data? 
  - etc. 
- Design and develop responsive layouts in Flutter (for smartphone, tablet, pc)
- Explore ThemeData
- Develop some cool domain specific (i.e. tennis) widgets

## What IÂ´ve learned
- TDD requires a lot more time (but green tests are pretty cool ;P)
- TDD makes you think more about good abstraction
- writing date and time independent tests is important
- using GitHub Milestones (+Issues) for project management 

I will keep adding stuff here as the project progresses.
